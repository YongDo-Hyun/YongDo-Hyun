## Personal / Direct Communication

Direct contact is appropriate only when public discussion is not reasonable.

### Appropriate Reasons

- Security concerns that should not be disclosed publicly (include enough detail to assess severity).
- Private information is required (credentials, internal logs you cannot publish, legal constraints).
- Coordinated disclosure, embargoed fixes, or time-sensitive release coordination.

### Not Appropriate

- Vague requests (“please help”, “it doesn’t work”) without technical details.
- Demands for timelines, priority, or bespoke support.
- Feature requests without a clear problem statement and constraints.
- Off-topic messages, general career questions, or repeated follow-ups without new information.

### If You Contact Me Directly, Include

- What you are trying to achieve, and why existing behavior blocks you.
- Exact environment details (OS, toolchain, versions, packaging method).
- Reproduction steps or a minimal test case.
- Relevant logs, stack traces, and error output.
- What you already tried, and what you observed.

If your message can be handled publicly, open an issue instead. Public issues help others, reduce duplication, and keep decisions traceable.
