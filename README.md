# README

I’m an independent open-source developer building large-scale, long-lived software with a strong bias toward correctness, clear architecture, and reproducible delivery. I optimize for maintainability and operational clarity, not short-term velocity.

## Focus Areas

- C++ application and library development
- Qt 6 / QML UI architecture and tooling
- Build systems and reproducible builds (including Nix)
- Packaging and distribution (Flatpak, Debian)
- CI/CD, release automation, and infrastructure (GitHub Actions)
- Git workflows, code review, and repository hygiene

## Development Philosophy

- Correctness is a feature: I prefer explicit invariants, strong types, and defensive interfaces.
- Architecture over accumulation: I design for change, testability, and clear boundaries.
- Reproducibility matters: builds and releases must be deterministic and auditable.
- Small, reviewable steps: incremental changes with clear intent beat large refactors without proof.
- Compatibility is deliberate: deprecations and breaking changes need a plan and documentation.

## Expectations From Contributors and Users

- Report issues with concrete data: versions, logs, minimal reproduction steps, and expected vs actual behavior.
- Keep changes scoped: one problem per pull request, with a clear rationale and tests where it matters.
- Follow existing conventions: style, structure, and project constraints are not optional.
- Avoid speculative changes: “might be useful” patches are usually noise unless there is a real use case.
- Be prepared to iterate: review feedback is part of engineering, not negotiation.

## Communication and Issues

I communicate directly and expect the same in return. Use issues for actionable, technical discussion. If you’re unsure whether something is a bug or a question, provide the facts you have and a minimal example; I will tell you what I need next. I will close threads that are vague, off-topic, or require unpaid consulting to define.
